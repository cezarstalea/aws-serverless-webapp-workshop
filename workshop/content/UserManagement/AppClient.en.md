### 3.1 Learn Your User Pool's Name

A new Cognito User Pool was created for you in previous step. You need to learn the name of newly created user pool, to distinguish it from user pools of other workshop participants. To learn the name, do the following:

**:white_check_mark: Step-by-step directions**

1. In Cloud9 repository, locate `wild-rydes/amplify/backend/auth` folder.
1. Locate subfolder prefixed with `wildrydes` and `parameters.json` file inside.
1. In parameters.json file locate **userPoolName** property. Cognito User Pool name will consist of the value of **userPoolName** property suffixed with environment name. For example in picture below, **userPoolName** is **wildrydes6f227ebc_userpool_6f227ebc**, hence the Cognito User Pool name is **wildrydes6f227ebc_userpool_6f227ebc-prod**

### 3.2 Check Your User Pool's App Client

A new App client has been created by the AWS Amplify build. Let's take a look at this app client. 

**:white_check_mark: Step-by-step directions**

1. Go to the [Amazon Cognito Console][cognito-console]
1. Choose **Manage User Pools**.

    Using the name you learned in step 3.1, find your new user pool generated by the AWS Amplify CLI that looks something similar to the example below:
    ![Amplify init screenshot](/aws-serverless-webapp-workshop/images/cognito-user-pool-name2.png)
    
1. **Click** the new user pool to open the Pool Details page
1. From the Pool Details page, select **App clients** from the **General settings** section in the left navigation bar.

1. You will see that a new App client has been generated.  Your web application is configured to use this App client via a config file located in `wild-rydes/src/aws-exports.js`.


#### How it Works: 
Rather than configuring each service through a constructor or constants file, Amplify supports configuration through a centralized file called aws-exports.js which defines all the regions and service endpoints to communicate. Whenever you run `amplify push` or rebuild your web application by running a `git commit`, this file is automatically created, allowing you to focus on your application code. The Amplify CLI places this file in the appropriate source directory configured with amplify init.

:heavy_exclamation_mark:  You won't see updates to this file in your local file store because it is included in the _.gitignore_ file.
